# Remote-Controlling-Robotic-Arm
Remote Controlling Mechanism between MSP430 & Arduino

# Description
By applying the knowledge learned in the Intro. to Embedded Systems to construct the wireless robotic arm, I build cross-device communication and task scheduling mechanism, and successfully integrated the remote-controlling modules between Arduino and MSP430 and utilized servo motors to manipulate the robotic mechanism. Fortunately, the product idea was awarded the 3rd prize, and this successful experience also led me to becomes more confident in embedded system development.
